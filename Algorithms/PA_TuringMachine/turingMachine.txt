Turning the Turing machine
The current state is: q0
The tape looks like: 10100
read <1> at tape index 0
Change state to <q0>, write <1> and move head right

Turning the Turing machine
The current state is: q0
The tape looks like: 10100
read <0> at tape index 1
Change state to <q0>, write <0> and move head right

Turning the Turing machine
The current state is: q0
The tape looks like: 10100
read <1> at tape index 2
Change state to <q0>, write <1> and move head right

Turning the Turing machine
