This is a program which will sort integers from a formatted input file
The algorithms used are iterative versions of quick sort and natural merge
sort, and utilize a linked implementation.

The input and output file names are supplied by the user 
at runtime as command line arguments, as per the project 
specifications. The main() class is sortMain.java
You can run the code with the following command:

sortMain.java /path/to/input.txt /path/to/output.txt

/path/to/input.txt = file path of the input file (can be any text file)
/path/to/output.txt = file path of the output file (can be any text file)

Java 10.0.1 was used in creation of this lab, but any recent version 
should be OK to run
